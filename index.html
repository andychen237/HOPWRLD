					<h2>PROBLEM SPACE AND DESIGN FOCUS</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The pandemic has effectively changed the landscape of college education and campus life as we know it. 
					With the move to remote education, almost all of our academic and social life is based on some virtual 
					meeting platform, and if you're the average 
					college student, you most likely live and breathe Zoom. 
					<br><br> Since these platforms were 
					not specifically designed for supporting our daily quarantine life,
					with this "new normal" that was thrown upon us, there still remains a significant gap between studying and 
					socializing virtually and physically. Whether it's Zoom fatigue, cabin fever, or the 
					unbearable pain of not being able to see your favorite CharMar lady, being a 
					student during these trying times is certainly tough. <br><br>

					Therefore, we introduce a brand-new VR platform, HOPWRLD, that will expand beyond the walls of your room to provide an 
					immersive, interactive environment to better engage college students academically and socially. We believe that with this VR platform, 
					all of us can not only learn better, but also live a better life (all without having to hear
					"Can you all see my screen?" from a professor ever again).

						<h2>User Research Process<br /></h2>
					</header>
					<p>For a user research study that comprehensively covers the diversity of the overall student experience, we decided to divide the college setting into 
						three key focus areas: the classroom lecture experience, the lab experience, 
						and the social experience (e.g. meetings, extracurriculars, etc.). To gain a 
						better understanding of how things operate virtually under these conditions, we decided to do a contextual 
						inquiry of three different users with a different college setting for each respective user and 
						also sent out questionnaires that covered these key aspects of the college experience.</p>

					<h2>Contextual Inquiry<br /></h2>
				</header>
				<p>For the contextual inquiry, we decided to take a mostly hands-off approach and simply watch
					each student in their "natural habitat" because we thought that would produce
					an authentic record of how students normally interact with these virtual operations in their day-to-day with as little
					interruptions as possible.
					Thus, it was more of an open-exploration study as opposed to a task-oriented one, and we simply just recorded observations
					and asked questions as see fit. <br><br>

					<strong>Case study: Lecture meeting</strong><br>
					This was quite a short-lived contextual inquiry because the user gave up on the task within ten minutes!
					The user was revisiting an asynchronous lecture of one of classes. She 
					attended the 
					live lecture earlier, but she could not stay focused and got 
					lost.
					Throughout the lecture, the user is clearly exasperated and expresses some of her frustrations. She 
					discouragingly points to the slides and remarks that the professor puts an 
					overwhelming amount of information on the slides. “I feel like we’re just learning a bunch of different 
					topics — it’s all breadth but no depth,” she expresses, “Going through the slides is like being bombarded 
					with an onslaught of information.”
					It was evident that the user couldn’t really focus; she was fidgeting, looking through her pencil case,
					distracting herself with side conversations, and also had not taken a single note on her notebook as 
					she skipped through portions of the video.<br></br>
					The user also states that no one is facilitating discussion to further the material. The professor doesn’t 
					do much either to engage the students and though he tries to make it interactive by making breakout rooms, 
					these breakout rooms 
					are infrequent, happening around once every two weeks. The format of 
					the breakout rooms are far from interactive — they usually consist of a simple Q&A discussion, 
					and usually, the question is answered right away, leaving an awkward interval of silence before the students 
					leave the breakout room. 
					After a few minutes, the user closes her notebook and exits the lecture, 
					deciding to return to the lecture for another time when she is more motivated to engage with the material.
					<br><br>

					<strong>Case study: Laboratory meeting</strong><br>
					The purpose of this contextual inquiry was to see how discussions with 
					researchers during a lab sync meeting occur in a virtual context. The subject 
					regularly attends lab meetings every week, and despite this fact she still searched 
					for the link to the meeting. Once the subject joined the call, she immediately muted 
					herself. Similar to our other findings from previous contextual inquiries of subjects 
					doing other tasks in an academic setting, we also noticed that this subject became 
					easily distracted since a hands-on environment like a laboratory cannot be replicated 
					in Zoom. On top of that, the subject was called on multiple times to engage in the 
					conversation, despite being distracted. This caused moments of miscommunication and 
					confusion for the subject, where she prompted others to repeat the question. 
					This was embarrassing for the subject. <br><br>

					<strong>Case study: Student team meeting</strong><br>
					To get a sense of what it is like for students to attend virtual meetings outside of the classroom, 
					but for social or academic purposes, we observed a student in his home, attending a Zoom call with 
					other students in his class. Overall, it seemed as though the subject was disengaged with 
					the meeting, and constantly scrolled through other windows and tabs while students were 
					talking during the call. We also noticed that for at least thirty minutes, he was bent over his 
					desk, which seemed to be bad for posture. When the subject tried to join a breakout room to speak 
					to other students in a more private setting, he noted that it was confusing to operate. 
					Overall, it seemed like he had a mediocre to dismal experience interfacing with others on Zoom. <br></p>

				<h2>User Questionnaire</h2>
				<p>We also created a questionnaire hosted on Google Forms that 8 users filled out to achieve a better idea of how users feel about current virtual education operations.
					This supplemented our contextual inquiry, which mostly consisted of observations, and gave us explicit feedback and ideas that
					we might not have garnered from solely observations.

						<h2>Analysis & Ideation<br /></h2>
					</header>

					<b>Through the contextual inquiry observations and the user questionnaire, we saw many
					running themes that pointed towards what is currently lacking in the virtual student
					experience.</b>
					<br><br>
					<i>- Users value interactions with other users the most; otherwise 
					they tend to feel too distracted during the Zoom meeting because of 
					the difference of not being in a traditional classroom setting and the inclination
					to multitask due to the availability of other websites/platforms to browse. The classes
					that were least successful were classes where there was a large breadth of information
					that was being regurgitated by the professor. They suggest more interactions with the professors and amongst students
					themselves to mitigate this lack of engagement.</i><br><br>

					<center><img src="images/bartsimpson.gif" alt="" width="300" height="240">
						<figcaption><i>A model of the average facial expression of the users of our study.</i></figcaption></center><br><br>

					<i>- Most users (62.5%) have not been able to make any new friends since 
					remote classes, and of those who answered the questions about extracurriculars, 
					none participate in extracurriculars, which shows a severely lacking social 
					experience during this time.</i><br><br>

					<i>- Online meetings feel impersonal and lack the human element that drives discussions and engagement. Also,
						the Zoom experience cannot capture how real-life interactions happen (for example, having private conversations
						with others).
					</i><br><br>

					<i>- The lab experience is lacking in hands-on experience and group work, 
					which is hindering the learning process and level of engagement during 
					these classes. During these limiting times, unfortunately, laboratory work is 
					limited to purely video demos and this is a huge pitfall for those looking to 
					gain laboratory experience.</i><br><br>

					<i>- Something we found that we did not exactly foresee in our studies was the fact that the users expressed
						greivances about the amount of eye strain, back pain, fatigue, and inactivity that they suffered through the respective Zoom engagements.
					</i><br><br>

					<p><b>After analyzing the results of our user research, we did a group brainstorm together
						using a Miro board to come up with solutions to the common problems we saw.</b><br>
				<a href="#" class="image fit"></a><img src="images/miroboard.jpg" alt="" width="786" height="623.2"/></a>
				<br><br>

				<b>From this group interpretation session, we came up with the components that 
				we wanted our VR prototype to primarily address:</b><br><br>

				<i>- We want to host an academically immersive and fun interface that allows one to better engage
					with lecture material and conduct laboratory experiments that resemble real life experiments as close as possible. 
					Because the opportunities of VR are endless, we hope to leverage upon this to simulate learning
					environments that build on lecture material in an unprecedented manner (for example, being essentially able to
					travel whereever and whenever!). These two functionalities (immersive lectures and laboratory experiments) will
					definitely change the college experience not just during COVID-19, but post-COVID-19 (if there is a post-COVID-19...)

				</i><br><br>
				<i>- To promote a more connected social experience during this time of isolation, the interface should provide a space 
					where users can talk freely, interact with professors and fellow students, arrange meetings,
					and do group activites. Social interaction should not be the painful and awkward experience that others
					frequently described it as, so we want to make this a large priority of our prototyping.
				</i><br><br>
				
				<i>- The VR classroom should allow one to walk around and have physical interactions with the environment, just 
					as one would in real life. This will help prevent the sedentary lifestyle that many of the users complained about.
				No more chronic back pain!!</i><br><br>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				<center><img src="images/zoomimage.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="240"/>
					<figcaption><i>Gone will be the days of breakout rooms that are 70% silence, 20% talking to people who are muted,
					and 10% pretending to do work when the professor checks in on the breakout room.</i></figcaption></center><br><br>

					<h2>Prototype</h2>
					<p>In designing our low-Fi prototype, we opted to use an application that many 
						gamers and people interested in architectural design prefer to use. The Sims 
						4 is a creative storytelling game that has incredible three dimensional graphics 
						and support for designing and creating all sorts of buildings and environments 
						suited to meet any lofty, creative ideas. Not only are NPC Sims readily available and can 
						interact with your avatar, but the current number of objects that are already 
						designed and rendered in the game is incredible. This makes it incredibly easy 
						to visualize a virtual reality space without the overhead of learning how to use 
						Blender or owning an expensive VR headset.<br><br>

						However, there are a few caveats when it comes to designing something like a 
						classroom prototype in a video game; one of them being the fact that you can only 
						interact with objects through a Sim. Also, despite the different types of gameplay 
						the Sims supports, there are few objects that could be used to model a laboratory 
						setting. Hence, we worked with a few inaccurate-looking game objects that were 
						classified as chemistry benches or scientific microscopes, but do not 
						mirror reality as closely as we would hope. Overall, the design process was simple. 
						We created the environments with the focus of fulfilling the ideas we brainstormed during ideation.
						In designing the landscape and architecture of the build, we also drew 
						inspiration from pictures of the Homewood campus to make it feel a little more like home.<br><br>
						
						<strong>Video prototype (demo):</strong>
						<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F9yvmHRal-M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br>

						The environment where the prototype evaluation was held is a multipurpose building 
						space with two labs — one resembling a wet lab and the other being more mechanical 
						engineering/robotics inspired. Downstairs, there is an area where students can 
						practice the fine arts like painting and music. Upstairs, we included a terrace 
						with activities like woodworking, floral arranging, and chess tables. To pay 
						homage to Brody Cafe, we decided to also include a small cafe space where users 
						can hang out and pretend that they are back in Brody Cafe, where they are waiting 
						on their mocha javas with whipped cream. Adjacent to the cafe, there are ping pong 
						and foosball tables where people can hang out and play games together. In VR, this 
						type of interaction is already possible. There are already games on the market that 
						give you a pretty realistic experience when it comes to playing games like ping pong 
						or mini golf, and you can play with other people! It would not be impossible to 
						implement environments where users can chat, emote, and play interactive games together. <br><br>
						
						Because VR is not widely accessible at the level where it could be used by college students universally, an
						alternate option we would like to offer is the ability to simply use one's mouse and eyeboard to interact with
						the world we created on this platform. Ideally, though, we think colleges investing in VR would be a great step that
						would elevate the academic experience. 

						On a more practical note, it is worth mentioning that applications like VRChat for Oculus already fulfill this 
						need expressed by students at Hopkins. 
						In VRChat, users are already able to select avatars and connect with people on the other side of cyberspace. 
						An amazing feature of VRChat is the creative worlds that users build, ranging from art museums to haunted 
						houses (upon exploring VRChat, I even came across a McDonalds). Therefore, we would like to make the point 
						that designing and deploying an environment where Hopkins students can interact is not only possible but 
						feasible. We could have our own private VRChat server that could only be accessed by Hopkins students, and 
						this could be advantageous to improving the Hopkins Experience that a lot of incoming students missed out 
						on due to the transition to online learning. Networking and making social connections is one of the most 
						memorable and paramount aspects of going to college.<br><br>

					<h2>Evaluation<br /></h2>
				</header>
				<p>We offered our two prototype evaluators three tasks to demonstrate the requirements 
					we had in mind for our prototype: <br><br>

					1) Explore the environment and get comfortable with the controls.<br>
					2) Interact with someone. For proof-of-concept, we used an NPC Sim as a pretend person a 
					user would normally interact with in a VR environment like VRChat. 
					This satisfied our social aspect that we wanted to emphasize in the prototype.<br>
					3) Find the lab and use the equipment there. This task demonstrates our inclusion of
					 hands-on learning experiences that lab classes offer. <br><br>
